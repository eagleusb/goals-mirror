=head2 Standard Functions

=head3 sort (list)

For example:

 sort (["c", "b", "b", "a"]) ⇒ ["a", "b", "c"]

This takes a list of strings and sorts it, removing duplicates.

=head3 subst (from, to, text)

For example:

 subst ("aa", "AA", "aabbccaa") ⇒ "AAbbccAA"
 subst ("a.*c", "b", "aaacac") ⇒ "bb"

This function works something like make’s C<subst> function, except
that C<from> is a regular expression, specifically a L<sed(1)>
extended regular expression.

=head3 wildcard (pattern)

For example:

 wildcard ("*.c") ⇒ ["bar.c", "foo.c"]

The single parameter is a wildcard which is expanded into a list of
files using ordinary globbing rules.

=head3 wrap (wrapper, list)

For example:

 wrap ("*file", ["bar.c", "foo.c"]) ⇒ [*file("bar.c"), *file("foo.c")]

Each element in C<list> is wrapped into a call to C<wrapper(element)>.
There are two common uses for this: either to add explicit tactics
(such as C<*file>) to a plain list of strings as in the example above;
or to turn a list of strings into a list of goal or function calls.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<goals(1)>.
