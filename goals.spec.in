%description
Make is a clever tool for expressing dependencies between files and it
is widely used for building software.  But it has some limitations.
It only knows about files.  It has limited ways to write rules.  And
for a tool whose main job is running shell commands, there are several
gotchas when you actually write shell commands.

Goals is an experimental tool which aims to generalize make beyond
these limitations.
