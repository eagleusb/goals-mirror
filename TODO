'let :=' for immediate evaluation in assignment.  Does this work for
included files?  Also ?= to only override if not already defined.

Default parameters, ie:
  goal foo (name, release = true) = ...
You might only allow defaults to be added to the end, or you
might allow goals to be called with labelled parameters.

Fix: You must use 'all ()' on the command line.

"Quiet" code.  Generally {CODE} sections in user files should be
echos, and those in stdlib should run silently (except if debugging).
Maybe we should have a quiet keyword to indicate this?

Deleting target files if goals is interrupted, but only if the
timestamp changes (what about non-*files?).  Also: atomic code.  This
will delete the target if the code doesn't run to completion.  (make
doesn't do this, but probably it should).

Implement parallel builds.

Conditional sections (same as "ifeq" etc in make).

Let within functions and goals, eg:
  function foo () =
    let temp = "%bar%baz";
    { .... }
Unclear if this would be helpful or not.
