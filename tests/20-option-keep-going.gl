# This tests the behaviour of the keep-going (-k) option.  This
# should build as many targets as possible.  The tree of goals
# looks like this:
#
#              fail3
#             /
#        fail1           good3       good6
#      /                 /           /
#  all  --- good1 --- good2 --- fail2
#      \                             \
#        good4 --- good5             good7 -- good8..20
#
# The following goals should run:
#   fail2, fail3, good3, good4, good5, good6, good7, good8..20
# The following goals should NOT run:
#   all, fail1, good1, good2
